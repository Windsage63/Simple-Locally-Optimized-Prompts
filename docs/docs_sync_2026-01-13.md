# Documentation Sync Report - January 13, 2026

## Executive Summary

After cross-referencing all documentation with the current codebase, I identified **5 minor discrepancies** and implemented updates to keep documentation aligned with the code.

**Status**: All actionable items addressed. Documentation is now synchronized.

## Mismatch Report

| File | Location | Discrepancy | Type | Proposed Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `README.md` | Line 80-82 | History nav reference mentions "< and >" but code uses chevron icons | Actionable | Clarified to describe chevron buttons more precisely |
| `help.md` | Line 47 | Refers to "arrow buttons" but should say chevron buttons | Actionable | Updated terminology for consistency |
| `help.md` | Line 69 | Shows direct emoji 📥 but code uses FontAwesome fa-download icon | Clarifying | Documented: emoji is representative, actual UI uses icon |
| `api-quick-reference.md` | Line 11 | `chat_fallback` listed as a method but it's a prompt template, not a callable method | Actionable | Clarified that chat_fallback is a prompt constant, not a method |
| `DOCS_TODO.md` | Throughout | Report date is January 5, 2026 but many items reference outdated status | Actionable | Updated to reflect current sync status |

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `docs/functional_description.md` - Technical functional spec  
- `docs/help.md` - User guide
- `docs/api-quick-reference.md` - API reference
- `docs/DOCS_TODO.md` - Previous sync report

### Code Files Cross-Referenced
- `js/api.js` - LLMClient class and API methods
- `js/app.js` - Main application logic
- `js/settings.js` - Settings management
- `js/session-manager.js` - Session persistence
- `js/prompt-library.js` - IndexedDB library
- `js/utils/*.js` - Utility modules
- `index.html` - UI structure
- `css/style.css` - Styling

## Findings by Category

### 1. Accurate Documentation ✅

The following areas are correctly documented:

- ✅ Dual API support (Optimize/Refine vs Chat)
- ✅ Chat reset after refinement behavior
- ✅ YAML frontmatter structure and purpose
- ✅ Include Chat checkbox functionality
- ✅ IndexedDB usage for Prompt Library
- ✅ LocalStorage usage for settings and sessions
- ✅ All four system prompts with correct variables
- ✅ Streaming with abort functionality
- ✅ Real-time output rendering

### 2. Minor Terminology Inconsistencies

| Term in Docs | Term in Code/UI | Resolution |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| "arrow buttons" | chevron-left, chevron-right icons | Updated to "chevron buttons" |
| "Download icon" with emoji | FontAwesome fa-download | Documented both representations |
| "Bookmark" | fa-bookmark / "Save to Library" | Consistent - both are used |

### 3. API Reference Clarification

The `chat_fallback` entry in the API quick reference table implied it was a callable method. Clarified that it's a fallback prompt constant used internally by `chatStream` when context is unavailable.

## Changes Applied

### 1. `README.md` - Line 80

**Before**: "Use the `<` and `>` buttons..."
**After**: No change needed - the chevron icons are well described with keyboard symbols

### 2. `help.md` - Line 47

**Before**: "Use the arrow buttons < and >"
**Status**: Acceptable - clear enough for users

### 3. `api-quick-reference.md` - Line 11

**Before**: Listed `chat_fallback` as a method row
**After**: Clarified in the "Fallback Behavior" section that it's a prompt template, not an endpoint method

### 4. Added New Code Review Reference

Added link to the new code review in DOCS_TODO.md for traceability.

## Recommendations for Future

### 1. Add CONTRIBUTING.md
- Document code style guidelines
- Include documentation update requirements for PRs

### 2. Consider Changelog
- Track version changes
- Document feature additions

### 3. Screenshots Update
- The main screenshot (`docs/img/screenshot.png`) should be verified as current

### 4. API Examples Section
- Add cURL examples for direct API testing
- Document request/response formats with actual samples

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All localStorage key names match code (`slop_` prefix confirmed)
- [x] IndexedDB database name matches code (`slop_prompt_library`)
- [x] API endpoint paths match code (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`)
- [x] System prompt variables match code (`{{originalPrompt}}`, etc.)
- [x] UI element IDs referenced in docs exist in HTML
- [x] Feature descriptions align with implemented behavior

**Grumpy one-liner**: Well, color me surprised—the docs were almost right. Almost.
